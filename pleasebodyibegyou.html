<h2 title="My body hurts all the time lol"> I'M DYING!</h2>
<p>Nah, just kidding, not dying, but my body does hurt.</p>
<p>It hurts so much, I'm literally devoting my entire practice site to 
    it. It's kind of funny. I like watching VS code trying to generate 
the text for me like it knows what I want to say before I do. No you don't, 
silly VS Code. Only I know what I want to say, not you. </p>

<h1> My Head Hurts</h1>
<p title= "my head hurts all the time lol"> You know what else hurts all the time? My head. Yep, my good old noggin, 
    the old noodle. It hurts a lot because I've been going through a lot of stress and I think its kinda silly that the brain responds to stress through
    pain. Like it's telling itself "Hey, this is kinda stressful, you know what we should do? We should cause oursevles even further discomfort by causing oureselves pain!" 
    Why does the brain do that?</p>
