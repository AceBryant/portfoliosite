<h1 title="It actually doesn't hurt anymore">Why My Body Hurts</h1>
<h2 title="My body hurts all the time lol"> I'M DYING!</h2>
<p>Nah, just kidding, not dying, but my body does hurt.</p>
<p>Actually this time its my brain thats hurting. I can't really let go of the conversation that my mom had with me over the weekend, and it's kinda starting to bother me a little? I shouldn't think about it, 
    but for some reason my mind REALLY doesn't want to let it go.  I dunno. </p>

<div>
<h1> My Head Hurts</h1>
<p title= "my head hurts all the time lol"> You know what else hurts all the time? My head. Yep, my good old noggin, 
    the old noodle. It hurts a lot because I've been going through a lot of stress and I think its kinda silly that the brain responds to stress through
    pain. Like it's telling itself "Hey, this is kinda stressful, you know what we should do? We should cause oursevles even further discomfort by causing oureselves pain!" 
    Why does the brain do that?
</p>
<p> Update: head still hurts this week.</p>
