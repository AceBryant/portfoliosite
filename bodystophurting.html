<h1>Body Stop Hurting</h1>
<h2 title="My body hurts all the time lol"> I'M DYING!</h2>
<p>Nah, just kidding, not dying, but my body does hurt.</p>
<p>Actually, this week my body doesn't hurt. I mean, it's only a matter of time before it starts hurting again, but that's just what happens every month. It'll keep going until I'm like 50 or something. </p>

<div>
<h1> My Head Hurts</h1>
<p title= "my head hurts all the time lol"> You know what else hurts all the time? My head. Yep, my good old noggin, 
    the old noodle. It hurts a lot because I've been going through a lot of stress and I think its kinda silly that the brain responds to stress through
    pain. Like it's telling itself "Hey, this is kinda stressful, you know what we should do? We should cause oursevles even further discomfort by causing oureselves pain!" 
    Why does the brain do that?</p>
